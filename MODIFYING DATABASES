In this SQL, I'm modifyting a table by updating, altering, and deleting information. Before modifying the table, I make sure to select all so to know exactly what to modify. Also I dropped the table. This was done on seperate databades.

# I corrected the author's name 
select * from documents;
update documents set author = 'Jackie Draper' where author = 'Jakie Paper';

#Delete row where title is "Things I'm afraid of"
select * from documents;
delete from documents where id = 5;
select * from documents;

TABLE 2
#I decided to add price column to the table
select * from clothes;
alter table clothes add column price text;

#updated item 1 = 10 dollars, item 2 = 20 daollars, item 3 = 30 dollars
select * from clothes;
update clothes set price = "10 dollars"
where id = 1;
update clothes set price = "20 dollars"
where id = 2;
update clothes set price = "30 dollars"
where id = 3;
select * from clothes;

#Finally, I dropped the table
drop table clothes;
select * from clothes;
